    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p>
       <h3>Step 1</h3>
       Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven. Add 3/4 cup chopped onion, green onions, and garlic; cook and stir until softened, about 4 minutes. Pour in soaked beans and fill with enough water to cover beans by 3 inches. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer uncovered for 2 hours, or until tender.
       <h3>Step 2</h3>
       While beans are cooking, place ham hocks in a smaller pot with 1/4 cup chopped onion. Cover with water and simmer until meat pulls off of the bone easily, about 1 hour. Drain and add to beans. 
       <h3>Step 3</h3>
       Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
       <h3>Step 4</h3>
       Place ham, bacon, and remaining onion in a baking dish. Bake until mixture is crispy, 15 minutes.
       <h3>Step 5</h3>
       Drain bacon and ham mixture and add to beans. Season with bay leaves, coriander, salt, and pepper. Simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes more.
       <h3>Step 6</h3>
       Stir in chopped cilantro and parsley just before serving.
