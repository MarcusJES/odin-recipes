    <P>    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2> 
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>Salt, to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>8 tablespoons (1 /2 cup) unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>4 1/4 cups tapioca flour</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 cups grated farmer cheese, or any firm, fresh cow's milk cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated cheddar cheese, optional</li>
        </ul>  
    </P>

    <p>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        Mix milk, salt, vegetable oil, and butter in a pot, and bring to a boil. As soon as it boils, remove from heat.
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        Stir tapioca flour into the milk and butter mixture.
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        Stir in the eggs and the cheese, and mix well.
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        Let mixture cool for 15 to 30 minutes so that it will be easier to handle. (You can chill it in the refrigerator for 15 minutes or so). Preheat oven to 350 F.
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        With floured (tapioca flour) hands, shape the dough into golf-ball-size balls and place them on a baking sheet.
        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        Bake rolls in the pre heated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until they are puffed up and golden. They will rise slowly and puff up mostly in the last 5 or 10 minutes. Serve warm.
